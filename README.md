# IRIS-FLOWER-DATA-CLASSIFICATION
An Iris flower has different features and species. 
We have a data in csv format of sepal's and petal's length and width with the suitable specie names i.e Iris satosa, Iris versicolor and Iris virginica.
Based on those features we train 70% of the model and when the model is trained, we then test the rest through different models.
This is a machine learning project where we train data and test it through different machine learning algorithms.
Both of my trained model i.e LogisticRegression and KNN predicted with 100% accuracy.
We also visualize our data through different commands and plots by using seaborn, matplotlib libraries.
We used various libraries required for different purposes i.e pandas, sklearn, os etc.
